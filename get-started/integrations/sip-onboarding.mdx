## Ringg SIP Infrastructure Details

### Server IPs

| IP Address | Region | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **35.211.140.39** | All regions | Primary — Point your inbound trunk here |
| **34.23.58.26** | KSA | Primary — Point your inbound trunk here |
| **35.207.251.56** | — | Secondary |

<Note>
For inbound use cases, point your trunk to **35.211.140.39** (all regions) or **34.23.58.26** (KSA) based on your region.
</Note>

### Ports and Protocols

| Protocol | Port | Transport | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SIP (UDP) | 5060 | UDP | Standard SIP signaling |
| SIP (TCP) | 5060 | TCP | Standard SIP signaling |
| SIPS (TLS) | 5061 | TCP | Encrypted SIP signaling |

### RTP Media Ports

| Port Range | Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10000–20000 | UDP | RTP / SRTP media streams |
| 50000–60000 | UDP | RTP / SRTP media streams (overflow) |

### Supported Codecs

| G.711 ulaw | 64 kbps |

### DTMF

- RFC 4733 (out-of-band)

---

## Security Options

Ringg supports two modes of SIP connectivity:

### Option A: Standard SIP (UDP/TCP)

Standard unencrypted SIP signaling on port **5060**.

- Transport: UDP or TCP
- No encryption on signaling or media
- Simpler setup, suitable for private network connections

### Option B: Secure SIP (TLS + SRTP) — Recommended

Encrypted SIP signaling (TLS) and encrypted media (SRTP).

| Component | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **SIP Signaling** | TLS v1.2 on port 5061 |
| **Media Encryption** | SRTP with SDES key exchange |
| **Certificate** | Self-signed (10-year validity) |
| **SIP URI Format** | `sips:extension@<server_ip>:5061` |

### Certificate Details

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Common Name (CN) | ringg-voip-server |
| Organization | Ringg |
| Location | North Charleston, South Carolina, US |
| Key Type | RSA 2048-bit |
| Signature Algorithm | SHA256WithRSAEncryption |

<Note>
Our certificate is self-signed. You may need to disable strict certificate verification or add our certificate to your trust store. We can provide the public certificate file upon request.
</Note>

## What We Need From You

Please provide the following information to complete the SIP trunk setup.

### IP Whitelisting (Required)

| # | Information Needed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Your SIP Server IP(s)** | IP addresses that will send/receive SIP traffic. These will be whitelisted on our firewall. |
| 2 | **Your Media Server IP(s)** | If different from SIP server IPs. Used for RTP/SRTP media streams. |

### Connection Details (Required)

| # | Information Needed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | **FQDN** | Your SIP server fully qualified domain name (if applicable) |
| 4 | **SIP Port** | Your SIP port (default: 5060 for UDP/TCP, 5061 for TLS) |
| 5 | **Transport Protocol** | UDP, TCP, or TLS |
| 6 | **Media Encryption** | None, or SRTP with SDES |
| 7 | **Preferred Codec** | alaw or ulaw |

### Authentication (If Applicable)

| # | Information Needed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | **Auth Required?** | Yes / No |
| 9 | **Username** | SIP authentication username |
| 10 | **Password** | SIP authentication password |
| 11 | **Realm** | SIP authentication realm (if applicable) |

<Note>
For bidirectional trunks (inbound + outbound), we will share a common username and password.
</Note>

### Call Routing (Required)

| # | Information Needed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | **Direction** | Inbound only, Outbound only, or Both |
| 13 | **DID Numbers** | Numbers assigned for inbound routing (if applicable) |
| 14 | **Caller ID** | Caller ID number to use for outbound calls (if applicable) |

### Custom SIP Headers (If Applicable)

If you send or expect custom SIP headers for call routing or metadata, please specify:

| # | Information Needed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 15 | **Custom Headers** | List of any custom SIP headers (e.g., `X-Agent-ID`, `X-Call-ID`, `X-CLIENT-ID`) |
| 16 | **Header Format** | Expected format/values for each header |

### PJSIP / SIP Configuration (If Available)

If you can share your SIP configuration details, it helps us set up the trunk faster:

| # | Information Needed | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 17 | **SIP Stack** | What SIP stack do you use? (e.g., Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, Kamailio, custom) |
| 18 | **Registration Required?** | Do you require SIP REGISTER? Yes / No |
| 19 | **Direct Media** | Do you support direct media (re-INVITE)? Yes / No |
| 20 | **NAT Traversal** | Are you behind NAT? Do you need rport / symmetric RTP? |

## Firewall Rules

### Your Side (Outbound from you to Ringg)

| Direction | Protocol | Destination IP | Port | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outbound | TCP | 35.211.140.39 | 5060 | SIP Signaling (TCP) |
| Outbound | UDP | 35.211.140.39 | 5060 | SIP Signaling (UDP) |
| Outbound | TCP | 35.211.140.39 | 5061 | SIP Signaling (TLS) |
| Outbound | UDP | 35.211.140.39 | 10000–20000 | RTP/SRTP Media |
| Outbound | UDP | 35.211.140.39 | 50000–60000 | RTP/SRTP Media (overflow) |

### Our Side (We will whitelist your IPs)

We will add your provided IPs to our firewall rules for the same ports listed above.

## Testing and Verification

### TLS Connectivity Test

To verify TLS connectivity from your side:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect 35.211.140.39:5061
```

### SIP OPTIONS Ping

Send a SIP OPTIONS request to verify basic SIP connectivity:

```bash
# Using sipsak (if available)
sipsak -s sip:test@35.211.140.39:5060 -v

# For TLS
sipsak -s sips:test@35.211.140.39:5061 -v
```

## Next Steps

Once you have gathered all the required information from the sections above and completed the setup on your side, send a single email to [admin@ringg.ai](mailto:admin@ringg.ai) with the following:

1. All details from the **"What We Need From You"** section (IP addresses, connection details, authentication, call routing, custom headers, and SIP configuration)
2. Confirmation that you have completed the firewall rules on your side

After we receive your details, we will configure the SIP trunk on our end and then coordinate a test call with you.

For any questions during the setup process, reach out to us at [admin@ringg.ai](mailto:admin@ringg.ai).
