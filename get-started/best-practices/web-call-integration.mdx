## Browser Compatibility Information

Ringg AI's Web Call integration is compatible with all modern browsers:

- **Chrome** 55+
- **Firefox** 53+
- **Safari** 11+
- **Edge** 79+
- **Opera** 42+

## For optimal performance:

- Ensure the browser has permission to access the microphone
- WebRTC capabilities must be enabled
- JavaScript must be enabled
- Mobile browsers are supported, but performance may vary based on device capabilities

## Placement and Visibility

- **Consistent positioning**: Place the Web Call button in a consistent location across your site, typically in the bottom right corner.
- **Visual contrast**: Ensure the button contrasts well with your website's background for better visibility.
- **Attention indicators**: Consider using subtle animations like pulsing to draw attention to the feature without being distracting.
- **Mobile optimization**: Ensure the button is appropriately sized and positioned on mobile devices.

## User Experience

- **Clear instructions**: Provide brief instructions on how to interact with the assistant when the call begins.
- **Introduction message**: Include a concise introduction explaining what the assistant can help with.
- **Text alternatives**: Offer text-based interaction options for users who prefer not to use voice.
- **Visual feedback**: Provide clear visual cues when the microphone is active or when the assistant is processing.

## Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous loading**: Load the Web Call script asynchronously to prevent blocking page rendering.
- **Lazy loading**: Consider loading the Web Call component only when the user scrolls near it.
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling to gracefully degrade if the service is unavailable.
- **Bandwidth management**: Inform users about potential data usage for voice calls, especially on mobile connections.

## Integration Setup

- **Domain whitelisting**: Add all domains where the assistant will be embedded to the whitelist.
- **CDN permissions**: Ensure your Content Security Policy allows the required CDN resources.
- **Cross-browser testing**: Test the integration across all major browsers and devices.
- **Version pinning**: Consider pinning to a specific version of the SDK instead of using "latest" for production environments.

## Customization

- **Brand alignment**: Customize button colors and styles to match your brand identity.
- **Contextual variables**: Pass relevant page or user context to the assistant to provide more personalized responses.
- **Custom button text**: Modify the button text to clearly communicate the purpose of the assistant.
- **Responsive design**: Ensure the Web Call interface adapts appropriately to different screen sizes.
