## API Key Management

- **Secure storage**: Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or browser-accessible files.
- **Environment variables**: Store your API key in environment variables or secure configuration systems.
- **Access control**: Implement proper access controls to limit who can use your API key.
- **Regular rotation**: Rotate your API key periodically, especially after team member departures.
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unusual API usage patterns that might indicate a compromised key.

## Data Protection

- **Minimize data collection**: Only collect and transmit the data necessary for the assistant to function.
- **Secure transmission**: Always use HTTPS for API requests to ensure encrypted data transmission.
- **Data retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies for call recordings and transcripts.
- **User consent**: Clearly inform users when calls are being recorded and obtain necessary consent.
- **PII handling**: Be cautious when handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and follow relevant regulations.

## Web Integration Security

- **Content Security Policy**: Configure your CSP to allow only the necessary Ringg AI resources.
- **Domain validation**: Verify that your domains are properly whitelisted in the Ringg AI dashboard.
- **Cross-site scripting protection**: Implement proper input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Iframe protection**: If embedding in an iframe, use appropriate sandbox attributes.
- **CORS configuration**: Ensure your CORS settings allow only necessary origins.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to systems and users.
- **Regular audits**: Periodically review who has access to your Ringg AI account and API keys.
- **Strong passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for your Ringg AI account.
- **Two-factor authentication**: Enable 2FA if available for your Ringg AI account.
- **Session management**: Implement proper session timeouts and invalidation procedures.

## Compliance Considerations

- **Privacy regulations**: Ensure your implementation complies with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- **Industry standards**: Follow industry-specific security standards if applicable (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.).
- **Disclosure requirements**: Clearly disclose to users that they are interacting with an AI assistant.
- **Opt-out mechanisms**: Provide clear ways for users to opt out of AI-powered calls.
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of your security measures and compliance efforts.
